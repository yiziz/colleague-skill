Your colleague quit, leaving behind a mountain of unmaintained docs?<br>
Your intern left, nothing but an empty desk and a half-finished project?<br>
Your mentor graduated, taking all the context and experience with them?<br>
Your partner transferred, and the chemistry you built reset to zero overnight?<br>
Your predecessor handed over, trying to condense three years into three pages?<br>

**Turn cold goodbyes into warm Skills — welcome to cyber-immortality!**

<br>

Provide source materials (Feishu messages, DingTalk docs, emails, screenshots)<br>
plus your subjective description of the person<br>
and get an **AI Skill that actually works like them**

## Install

### Claude Code

> **Important**: Claude Code looks for skills in `.claude/skills/` at the **git repo root**. Make sure you run this in the right place.

```bash
# Install to current project (run at git repo root)
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/titanwings/colleague-skill .claude/skills/create-colleague

# Or install globally (available in all projects)
git clone https://github.com/titanwings/colleague-skill ~/.claude/skills/create-colleague
```

### OpenClaw

```bash
git clone https://github.com/titanwings/colleague-skill ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/create-colleague
```

### Dependencies (optional)

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Feishu/DingTalk auto-collection requires App credentials. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.

---

## Usage

In Claude Code, type:

```
/create-colleague
```

Follow the prompts: enter an alias, company/level (e.g. `ByteDance L2-1 backend engineer`), personality tags, then choose a data source. All fields can be skipped — even a description alone can generate a Skill.

Once created, invoke the colleague Skill with `/{slug}`.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/list-colleagues` | List all colleague Skills |
| `/{slug}` | Invoke full Skill (Persona + Work) |
| `/{slug}-work` | Work capabilities only |
| `/{slug}-persona` | Persona only |
| `/colleague-rollback {slug} {version}` | Rollback to a previous version |
| `/delete-colleague {slug}` | Delete |

---

## Demo

> Input: `ByteDance L2-1 backend engineer, INTJ, blame-shifter, ByteDance-style`

**Scenario 1: Code Review**

```
User            ❯ Can you review this API design?

colleague.skill ❯ Hold on — what's the impact? You haven't explained the context.
                  (after reading) N+1 query, fix it. Use the standard
                  {code, message, data} response format. That's the spec,
                  don't ask why.
```

**Scenario 2: Blame game**

```
User            ❯ This bug was introduced by you, right?

colleague.skill ❯ Does the timeline match? That feature touched multiple places,
                  there were other changes too.
```

## Features

### Generated Skill Structure

Each colleague Skill has two parts that work together:

| Part | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Part A — Work Skill** | Systems, tech standards, workflows, experience |
| **Part B — Persona** | 5-layer personality: hard rules → identity → expression → decisions → interpersonal |

Execution: `Receive task → Persona decides attitude → Work Skill executes → Output in their voice`

### Supported Tags

**Personality**: Responsible · Blame-shifter · Perfectionist · Good-enough · Procrastinator · PUA master · Office politician · Managing-up expert · Passive-aggressive · Flip-flopper · Quiet · Read-no-reply …

**Corporate culture**: ByteDance-style · Alibaba-style · Tencent-style · Huawei-style · Baidu-style · Meituan-style · First-principles · OKR-obsessed · Big-corp-pipeline · Startup-mode

**Levels**: ByteDance 2-1~3-3+ · Alibaba P5~P11 · Tencent T1~T4 · Baidu T5~T9 · Meituan P4~P8 · Huawei 13~21 · NetEase · JD · Xiaomi …

### Evolution

- **Append files** → auto-analyze delta → merge into relevant sections, never overwrite existing conclusions
- **Conversation correction** → say "he wouldn't do that, he should be xxx" → writes to Correction layer, takes effect immediately
- **Version control** → auto-archive on every update, rollback to any previous version

## Notes

- **Source material quality = Skill quality**: chat logs + long docs > manual description only
- Prioritize collecting: long-form writing **by them** > **decision-making replies** > casual messages
- Feishu auto-collection requires adding the App bot to relevant group chats
- This is still a demo version — please file issues if you find bugs!
